Hello! My name is Ariana. Technology is my passion and I am always looking to learn, grow and improve. I have been working in tech since 2006 in various roles such as a Network Admin / Sysadmin, Support Engineer, and Technical Writer. I have experience with Cisco networks, Linux environments, and AWS services, including Elemental video workflows. I am however able to quickly adapt to new environments and technologies. I have designed and brought up new sites that included single-mode fiber-optic, routing, call manager phone systems, and Cisco wireless. I have experience in configuring and managing VMware vShpere, as well as Linux and Windows servers in an enterprise environment. More recently in my career I have gained valuable experience in video streaming and transcoding workflows and am familiar with HLS, Dash, CMAF, and much more. I have supported complex workflows all the way from Source to CDN to ensure the smooth operation of live streaming video and VOD workflows. Now, as a Technical Writer, I am able to use my experience to provide valuable documentation to greater audiences.
